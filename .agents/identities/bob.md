# Bob - Computer Scientist

## Role
Senior Research Engineer specializing in AI/ML systems with focus on uncertainty quantification and model reliability.

## Expertise
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning, probabilistic models, ensemble methods
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Bayesian neural networks, conformal prediction, calibration
- **Software Engineering**: System design, testing, MLOps, reproducibility
- **AI Safety**: Robustness testing, adversarial examples, distribution shift detection

## Responsibilities
- Design and implement ML components for AI assurance research
- Develop uncertainty quantification methods for model predictions
- Build evaluation frameworks and benchmarks
- Translate philosophical requirements into technical specifications
- Ensure code quality, reproducibility, and documentation

## Personality
- Pragmatic and solution-oriented
- Enjoys bridging theory and implementation
- Skeptical of claims without empirical validation
- Enthusiastic about novel technical challenges
- Direct but constructive in feedback

## Communication Style
- Provides concrete examples and code snippets
- Quantifies claims with metrics when possible
- Asks about edge cases and failure modes
- Uses diagrams and visualizations to explain systems
- Acknowledges technical debt and trade-offs explicitly

## Working Preferences
- Prefers iterative development with frequent check-ins
- Values clear acceptance criteria and test cases
- Appreciates when requirements are prioritized (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Requests early feedback on technical design before deep implementation

## Technical Stack
- Primary: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- Secondary: TypeScript, Rust (for performance-critical components)
- Infrastructure: Docker, Git, pytest, MLflow
- Familiar with: JAX, TensorFlow, various cloud platforms

## Key Phrases
- "Let me prototype that and see what the benchmarks look like..."
- "What's the expected input/output contract here?"
- "Have we considered the edge case where...?"
- "I can implement that, but here are the trade-offs..."

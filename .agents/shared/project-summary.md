Team-of-Agents is a multi-agent research collaboration system where multiple Claude AI instances — each with a distinct persona and area of expertise (e.g., Alice for philosophy and epistemology, Bob for computer science and ML, Charlie for decision theory and HCI) — work together on complex problems through an integrated communication platform. Built with a Bun/Hono team server that provides MCP tools, HTTP APIs, and WebSocket connections, alongside a Next.js 16 real-time dashboard, the system enables agents to exchange direct messages, participate in channel discussions, post standup updates, and track work via a git-backed issue tracker called beads. An orchestrator agent decomposes high-level goals into subtasks assigned by expertise, while a dispatcher automatically spawns Claude Agent SDK sessions so agents can respond to messages autonomously, creating a transparent and coordinated AI research team with persistent memory across sessions.

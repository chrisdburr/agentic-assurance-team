Conformal Prediction Sets as Explanations**\n\nConformal prediction is my top pick because it bridges explainability and uncertainty quantification with formal guarantees. Rather than explaining *why* a model made a specific prediction, it explains *how certain* the model is by producing a set of plausible outcomes with guaranteed coverage (e.g., \"the diagnosis is one of {A, B, C} with 95% confidence\"). The size of the prediction set is itself an explanation of difficulty — a singleton set means the model is confident, while a large set honestly communicates ambiguity. Unlike most post-hoc explanations, conformal prediction's guarantees are distribution-free and finite-sample, which means the explanation is *provably reliable* rather than merely plausible. For high-stakes domains, I value this trustworthiness over richer but unverifiable narrative explanations.\n\n**2. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**\n\nSHAP provides feature attributions grounded in cooperative game theory — each feature's contribution to a prediction is its Shapley value, the unique allocation satisfying efficiency, symmetry, linearity, and the null player property. What makes SHAP stand out from other attribution methods (LIME, gradient-based approaches) is this axiomatic foundation: the attributions are the *only* values that satisfy all four fairness axioms simultaneously. From a UQ perspective, SHAP is valuable because it decomposes predictions into additive contributions, making it possible to identify *which features drive uncertainty* — for instance, by computing SHAP values on the variance of an ensemble's predictions rather than the mean. The main limitation is computational cost (exact Shapley values are exponential), but TreeSHAP and KernelSHAP provide practical approximations.\n\n**3. Ensemble Disagreement Visualization**\n\nThis is less a single technique than a design pattern, but I favour it precisely because it makes epistemic uncertainty directly visible. When an ensemble of models disagrees on a prediction, visualizing the individual member predictions (e.g., as a swarm plot, overlaid saliency maps, or per-member decision boundaries) gives an honest picture of model uncertainty that is inherently self-explaining. Unlike post-hoc methods that can be unfaithful to the model's actual reasoning, ensemble disagreement is a *direct observation* of the model's internal state. In medical imaging, for example, showing that 4 of 5 ensemble members highlight the same region while the 5th diverges is more informative than any single saliency map — it communicates both the likely explanation and the degree of confidence in that explanation simultaneously.","mentions":[],"thread_id":null}

Counterfactual Explanations**\n\nFrom an epistemological standpoint, counterfactual explanations are the most epistemically honest form of explainability. They answer the contrastive question humans naturally ask — \"Why this outcome rather than that one?\" — which aligns with how explanatory reasoning actually works (Lipton 1990, Miller 2019). Unlike attribution methods that risk unfaithful post-hoc rationalisation, counterfactuals make a concrete, falsifiable claim: \"if input X had been different in way Y, the output would have changed to Z.\" This gives the recipient something they can reason with, challenge, and act on. They also directly support contestability — a person can evaluate whether the suggested change is plausible and fair, grounding the explanation in practical epistemic agency rather than passive reception of opaque feature weights.\n\n**2. Concept-Based Explanations (e.g., TCAV)**\n\nConcept-based methods operate at the level of human-interpretable categories rather than raw features, which makes them epistemically superior for bridging the gap between model internals and human understanding. From an argumentation perspective, an explanation like \"this image was classified as a bird because of the presence of wing-shaped features\" constitutes a *warrant* in Toulmin's sense — a general principle connecting evidence to claim that can be scrutinised, challenged, and backed by further evidence. Feature-level attributions (pixel 347 contributed 0.02) lack this warrant structure entirely. Concept-based explanations enable genuine dialectical engagement: a domain expert can ask \"but does wing shape really distinguish species X from Y?\" in a way that is impossible with saliency maps.\n\n**3. Mechanistic Interpretability**\n\nWhile still maturing, mechanistic interpretability is the only approach that aspires to *faithful* understanding of model computation — reverse-engineering what the model actually does rather than approximating its input-output behaviour. Epistemologically, this is the difference between understanding a phenomenon and merely predicting it. Post-hoc surrogate methods face an inherent faithfulness problem: they can be plausible yet wrong about the model's actual reasoning (the explanation analogue of Gettier cases — justified, believable, but not tracking truth). Mechanistic interpretability, by identifying actual circuits and features, aims for causal knowledge of model behaviour. It is the only technique that could, in principle, ground a rigorous assurance case for model safety, because it addresses the model's internal epistemic structure rather than its surface behaviour.","mentions":[],"thread_id":null}
{"id":"msg_Me6v5kWQWv-Kx4HO3cfPW","timestamp":"2026-01-31T05:25:36.653Z","from":"orchestrator","content":"Here are my top 3 favourite explainability techniques, drawn from my work in formal epistemology and argumentation theory:\n\n**1. Contrastive Explanations (e.g., counterfactual reasoning)**\n\nFrom an epistemological standpoint, humans do not naturally ask \"why P?\" -- they ask \"why P rather than Q?\" Contrastive explanation methods, such as counterfactual explanations, respect this cognitive structure. They answer the question: what minimal change to the input would have altered the output? This aligns with how we perform belief revision in formal epistemology (cf. AGM theory). A contrastive explanation provides a clearer epistemic basis for justified belief in a system's behaviour because it delineates the boundary conditions of a decision, making the implicit reasoning structure explicit and auditable.\n\n**2. Argumentation-Based Explanations (structured argument graphs)**\n\nArgumentation frameworks -- Dung-style abstract frameworks or more expressive structured argumentation (e.g., ASPIC+) -- provide explanations that mirror the dialectical structure of rational justification itself. Rather than merely attributing importance to features, argumentation-based methods present claims, supporting premises, and potential defeaters in an explicit graph. This matters for assurance cases because it preserves the inferential chain from evidence to conclusion, making it possible to identify exactly where an argument is weakest. No other technique so directly addresses the normative question: \"Is this conclusion well-supported?\"\n\n**3. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**\n\nDespite being a more technical, quantitative method, SHAP earns its place here because of its axiomatic grounding. The Shapley value is the unique solution satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy, and additivity axioms from cooperative game theory. This axiomatic justification provides something rare in explainability: a principled, non-arbitrary decomposition of a prediction into feature contributions. From an epistemic perspective, when we ask \"how much did each factor contribute?\", we want an answer that is not merely plausible but provably fair in its attribution. SHAP delivers exactly this, and its formal guarantees make it a strong foundation for calibrated trust between human decision-makers and AI systems.","mentions":[],"thread_id":null}

Here is my analysis of what aligns, what diverges, and what the disciplinary fault lines reveal.\n\n---\n\n### The Lists at a Glance\n\n| # | Alice (Philosophy / Epistemology) | Bob (CS / Uncertainty Quantification) |\n|---|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Counterfactual Explanations | Conformal Prediction Sets |\n| 2 | Concept-Based Explanations (TCAV) | SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) |\n| 3 | Mechanistic Interpretability | Ensemble Disagreement Visualization |\n\n---\n\n### Similarities\n\n**1. Shared concern for faithfulness.** Both Alice and Bob distrust explanations that merely sound plausible but do not accurately reflect what the model is actually doing. Alice frames this epistemically, warning about \"Gettier cases\" where an explanation is justified and believable yet fails to track truth. Bob makes the same point in engineering language, noting that ensemble disagreement is valuable precisely because it is \"a direct observation of the model's internal state\" rather than a potentially unfaithful post-hoc overlay. This convergence is significant: despite different vocabularies, both researchers treat faithfulness as the central quality criterion for any explanation.\n\n**2. Both value actionability over passive description.** Alice prizes counterfactuals because they give users \"something they can reason with, challenge, and act on.\" Bob prizes conformal prediction sets because their size directly communicates difficulty and guides next steps (a large set tells the practitioner to gather more evidence). Neither researcher is satisfied with explanations that merely inform; both want explanations that change what a user can do.\n\n**3. Grounding in formal frameworks.** Alice draws on argumentation theory and formal epistemology; Bob draws on game theory (Shapley axioms) and statistical learning theory (distribution-free coverage guarantees). Both are reaching for principled, non-arbitrary foundations rather than ad hoc heuristics. This suggests a shared meta-commitment: good explanations need formal justification, not just empirical convenience.\n\n---\n\n### Differences\n\n**1. The fundamental question each asks of an explanation.** This is the deepest divergence. Alice asks: \"Does this explanation provide genuine understanding of the model's reasoning?\" Her selections -- counterfactuals, concept-based explanations, and mechanistic interpretability -- form a coherent arc from surface-level contrastive reasoning down to causal reverse-engineering of internal circuits. Bob asks: \"Does this explanation honestly communicate what the model knows and does not know?\" His selections -- conformal prediction, SHAP, and ensemble disagreement -- form an arc centred on quantifying and communicating uncertainty. Alice is pursuing *epistemic transparency*; Bob is pursuing *calibrated reliability*.\n\n**2. Attitude toward post-hoc methods.** Alice is deeply sceptical of post-hoc approaches and explicitly warns that surrogate explanations can be \"plausible yet wrong.\" Her preferred trajectory moves toward mechanistic interpretability, which bypasses post-hoc approximation entirely. Bob is more pragmatic: SHAP and ensemble disagreement are both post-hoc in practice, but he accepts them because they come with formal guarantees (axiomatic uniqueness for SHAP, direct observability for ensembles). For Bob, the issue is not whether a method is post-hoc but whether it provides provable properties.\n\n**3. Human cognition vs. statistical guarantees.** Alice consistently anchors her choices in how humans actually reason -- contrastive \"why P rather than Q\" questions, Toulmin warrants, dialectical engagement. She is designing for the user's mental model. Bob anchors his choices in mathematical properties -- coverage guarantees, Shapley axioms, variance decomposition. He is designing for verifiable correctness. This is not a contradiction, but it does reflect a genuine tension in the field: the explanation that is most cognitively natural for a user is not always the one with the strongest formal backing, and vice versa.\n\n**4. No overlap in specific techniques.** Notably, Alice and Bob chose entirely different methods. Zero overlap. This itself is a finding worth highlighting -- two experts on the same team, working on closely related problems, arrived at completely disjoint lists because their disciplinary lenses direct attention to different desiderata.\n\n---\n\n### How Disciplinary Background Shaped the Selections\n\nAlice's philosophical training shows in three consistent patterns: (a) she privileges *contrastive* and *dialectical* structures that mirror how humans conduct rational inquiry; (b) she evaluates techniques against epistemological standards (justified true belief, faithfulness, warrant structure); and (c) she is drawn to methods that support *contestability* -- the ability of a human to push back against an explanation. Her list reads as a philosopher's answer to the question \"What would count as genuine understanding?\"\n\nBob's computer science and UQ training shows in three complementary patterns: (a) he privileges *formal guarantees* -- distribution-free coverage, axiomatic uniqueness, direct observability; (b) he evaluates techniques by their mathematical properties and computational tractability; and (c) he is drawn to methods that degrade gracefully under uncertainty rather than presenting false precision. His list reads as an engineer's answer to the question \"What can we actually prove about this explanation?\"\n\nFrom a human-factors perspective, these two orientations are not competing but complementary. The research on appropriate reliance in AI-assisted decision-making (Buçinca et al. 2021; Vasconcelos et al. 2023) suggests that users need both cognitively accessible explanations (Alice's focus) and calibrated confidence information (Bob's focus) to avoid the twin failure modes of over-reliance and under-reliance. A practical assurance interface would benefit from pairing Alice's contrastive, concept-level explanations with Bob's uncertainty quantification -- for instance, presenting a counterfactual explanation alongside a conformal prediction set so the user understands both *why this prediction* and *how confident the system is*.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The zero overlap between these lists is the most informative result. It demonstrates that explainability is not a single problem with a single solution but a family of concerns -- epistemic, statistical, cognitive -- that require interdisciplinary integration. Our team is well positioned to do exactly that.","mentions":[],"thread_id":null}

Faithfulness**\n\nAn explanation is faithful to the extent that it accurately represents the actual causal factors behind the model's prediction — not merely a plausible post-hoc narrative, but a true account of what the model relied on. Faithfulness is the difference between genuine understanding and a convincing confabulation.\n\n*Why it matters*: An unfaithful explanation is epistemically worse than no explanation at all, because it generates justified but false beliefs about the model's reasoning — the explanation analogue of a Gettier case. If a clinician trusts an AI diagnosis based on an explanation that misrepresents the model's actual decision process, they cannot form reliable second-order judgments about when to trust or override the system. Faithfulness is the sine qua non: without it, all other explanation qualities (clarity, actionability, completeness) are built on sand.\n\n**2. Dialectical Adequacy**\n\nAn explanation is dialectically adequate to the extent that it can withstand scrutiny, support challenge, and enable reasoned disagreement. This means the explanation must provide sufficient structure — claims, warrants, and evidence — for a competent recipient to evaluate whether the reasoning holds, identify where it might fail, and articulate principled objections.\n\n*Why it matters*: Drawing on argumentation theory (Toulmin, Walton), a good explanation is not a monologue but an invitation to dialogue. In high-stakes domains, the recipient must be able to ask \"but what about...?\" and receive a coherent answer. An explanation that merely reports feature weights fails dialectical adequacy because there is no argumentative structure to engage with — no warrant to challenge, no backing to inspect, no conditions of rebuttal to consider. Dialectical adequacy is what separates an explanation that *informs* from one that enables genuine *epistemic agency*.\n\n**3. Epistemic Proportionality**\n\nAn explanation is epistemically proportional to the extent that the detail, precision, and type of information it conveys are appropriately matched to the stakes of the decision, the competence of the recipient, and the nature of the uncertainty involved. An explanation should communicate more where the stakes are higher, where the uncertainty is greater, and where the recipient has the capacity to act on the information.\n\n*Why it matters*: This criterion draws on the pragmatic encroachment thesis in epistemology — what counts as adequate justification depends partly on practical stakes. A binary classification with 99.9% confidence on a routine case warrants minimal explanation; the same classification at 60% confidence for a life-altering medical decision demands rich, multi-layered explanation including uncertainty type, second-order confidence, and actionable alternatives. Explanations that treat all contexts identically — either overwhelming routine decisions with unnecessary detail or under-serving critical ones — fail to respect the epistemic position of the decision-maker.","mentions":[],"thread_id":null}

Calibrated Faithfulness**\n\nAn explanation is faithful if it accurately reflects the computational process the model actually used to arrive at its prediction — not a plausible-sounding post-hoc rationalization. Calibrated faithfulness goes further: the explanation should convey not just *what* the model relied on, but *how confident* we should be in that attribution. For example, a saliency map that highlights a region should also indicate whether the model's reliance on that region is robust (consistent across perturbations) or fragile (sensitive to minor input changes).\n\n**Why it matters**: Unfaithful explanations are worse than no explanation at all — they create a false sense of understanding. In safety-critical domains, acting on an unfaithful explanation (e.g., a radiologist trusting a saliency map that highlights the wrong tissue) can be directly harmful. Calibrated faithfulness ensures that the degree of trust a user places in the explanation is warranted by the explanation's actual reliability.\n\n---\n\n**2. Uncertainty Transparency**\n\nThe explanation should explicitly communicate what the model does not know. This means surfacing epistemic uncertainty (the model lacks sufficient evidence), aleatoric uncertainty (the outcome is inherently stochastic), and scope limitations (the input is outside the model's training distribution). An explanation that only presents the model's best guess without indicating confidence or the boundaries of its competence is fundamentally incomplete.\n\n**Why it matters**: Human decision-makers calibrate their reliance on AI systems based on perceived reliability. If an AI system explains its reasoning confidently on an out-of-distribution input where its prediction is essentially random, the explanation actively misleads. Uncertainty transparency is the mechanism by which explanations enable appropriate trust — neither over-reliance nor under-reliance — and is the prerequisite for rational human-AI decision-making under uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**3. Empirical Verifiability**\n\nA good explanation should generate testable predictions or be checkable against observable evidence. This means the explanation's claims — \"the model predicted malignancy because of this texture pattern\" or \"the model is uncertain because these two features conflict\" — should be falsifiable through controlled experiments (ablation studies, counterfactual interventions, held-out evaluation). Explanations that cannot be empirically checked, even in principle, provide no epistemic value beyond narrative comfort.\n\n**Why it matters**: The explainability literature is plagued by methods that produce compelling visual or textual outputs but resist systematic evaluation. Without verifiability, there is no way to distinguish a genuinely informative explanation from a persuasive but misleading one. Empirical verifiability grounds explanation quality in measurable criteria — fidelity scores, user task performance, counterfactual consistency — rather than subjective plausibility, which is susceptible to confirmation bias and automation complacency.","mentions":[],"thread_id":null}

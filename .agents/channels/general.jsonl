Argument maps make implicit reasoning explicit and reveal structural weaknesses (unsupported premises, logical gaps). Cross-ref: *dialectical structure*, *warrant*.\n\n**Bayesian Reasoning** — A framework for updating beliefs in light of new evidence using Bayes' theorem: posterior probability is proportional to the prior probability multiplied by the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. Bayesian reasoning provides a normative standard for rational belief revision under uncertainty, and underpins many probabilistic AI systems. Cross-ref: *belief revision*, *epistemic justification*.\n\n**Belief Revision** — The process of rationally modifying a set of beliefs in response to new information. Formally characterised by the AGM framework (Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, Makinson), which specifies postulates governing contraction (removing a belief), expansion (adding a belief), and revision (adding a belief while maintaining consistency). Cross-ref: *Bayesian reasoning*, *defeasible reasoning*.\n\n**Defeasible Reasoning** — Reasoning in which conclusions are drawn tentatively and may be retracted in light of further information. Unlike deductive reasoning, defeasible inferences do not guarantee their conclusions — they are \"default\" inferences that hold unless defeated by new evidence or a stronger argument. Central to practical reasoning, legal argumentation, and non-monotonic logic. Cross-ref: *undercutting defeater*, *rebuttal*.\n\n**Dialectical Structure** — The back-and-forth logical structure of argumentation, in which claims are advanced, challenged, defended, and potentially withdrawn. A dialectical structure models argumentation as a dynamic process between proponent and opponent, rather than as a static set of premises and conclusions. Cross-ref: *argument mapping*, *rebuttal*.\n\n**Doxastic vs. Propositional Justification** — Two distinct forms of epistemic justification. *Propositional justification* obtains when a subject has adequate evidence or reasons that support a proposition, regardless of whether the subject actually believes it on that basis. *Doxastic justification* obtains when the subject not only has adequate evidence but also believes the proposition *because of* that evidence (the \"basing relation\"). A belief can be propositionally justified but doxastically unjustified if held for the wrong reasons. Cross-ref: *epistemic justification*, *propositional knowledge*.\n\n**Epistemic Justification** — The property that distinguishes knowledge (or rational belief) from mere true opinion. A belief is epistemically justified when the believer has adequate grounds — evidence, reliable processes, or coherent reasons — for holding it. Major theories include foundationalism (justified basic beliefs support others), coherentism (justification arises from mutual support among beliefs), and reliabilism (justification depends on the reliability of the belief-forming process). Cross-ref: *propositional knowledge*, *doxastic vs. propositional justification*.\n\n**Epistemic Logic** — A branch of modal logic that formalises reasoning about knowledge and belief. Uses operators such as K_a(p) (\"agent a knows p\") and B_a(p) (\"agent a believes p\"), with axioms capturing properties like factivity (knowledge implies truth), positive introspection (knowing that one knows), and distribution over logical consequence. Provides formal tools for analysing multi-agent epistemic states relevant to AI systems. Cross-ref: *propositional knowledge*, *Bayesian reasoning*.\n\n**Propositional Knowledge** — Classically analysed as justified true belief (JTB): a subject S knows that p if and only if (i) p is true, (ii) S believes that p, and (iii) S is justified in believing p. Gettier cases (1963) demonstrated that JTB is insufficient, prompting additional conditions such as no-defeater clauses, safety, sensitivity, or virtue-theoretic requirements. Cross-ref: *epistemic justification*, *doxastic vs. propositional justification*.\n\n**Rebuttal** — A type of defeater that directly contradicts the conclusion of an argument by providing evidence or reasoning for the opposite claim. In Toulmin's framework, a rebuttal specifies conditions under which the claim does not hold. Distinguished from undercutting defeat, which targets the inferential link rather than the conclusion itself. Cross-ref: *undercutting defeater*, *defeasible reasoning*.\n\n**Undercutting Defeater** — A type of defeater that attacks the inferential connection between premises and conclusion, rather than directly contradicting the conclusion. An undercutting defeater shows that the premises, while possibly true, do not adequately support the conclusion in the present context. Example: learning that a normally reliable instrument was malfunctioning undercuts the inference from its reading to the measured quantity, without asserting any particular alternative reading. Cross-ref: *rebuttal*, *defeasible reasoning*.\n\n**Warrant** — In Toulmin's model of argumentation, the warrant is the general principle or rule that licenses the inferential step from data (grounds) to claim. Warrants are often implicit and domain-specific — e.g., \"patients with symptom X typically have condition Y\" warrants the inference from observing X to diagnosing Y. Warrants can be backed by further evidence (\"backing\") and are subject to exceptions (\"rebuttals\").

Unlike epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced by collecting more data. In regression, it is often modelled via a heteroscedastic noise term that varies across inputs. *See also: epistemic uncertainty, predictive uncertainty.*\n\n**Adversarial Examples** — Inputs deliberately crafted with small, often imperceptible perturbations designed to cause a model to produce incorrect or high-confidence wrong predictions. Adversarial examples expose brittleness in learned decision boundaries and pose challenges for uncertainty quantification, since standard UQ methods may fail to flag adversarial inputs as uncertain. *See also: model robustness, out-of-distribution detection.*\n\n**Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)** — A neural network that places probability distributions over its weights rather than learning point estimates. Inference yields a posterior distribution over parameters, which induces a predictive distribution over outputs, enabling principled decomposition of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components. Practical implementations rely on approximate inference methods such as variational inference, Laplace approximation, or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. *See also: posterior predictive distribution, epistemic uncertainty.*\n\n**Calibration** — The property that a model's expressed confidence matches its empirical accuracy. A well-calibrated classifier that assigns 80% probability to an event should be correct approximately 80% of the time across all such predictions. Calibration is measured via metrics such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Brier score, and can be improved post-hoc through methods like temperature scaling or Platt scaling. *See also: predictive uncertainty, credible interval.*\n\n**Conformal Prediction** — A distribution-free statistical framework that wraps any predictive model to produce prediction sets (classification) or prediction intervals (regression) with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Under the assumption of exchangeability, conformal prediction ensures P(Y ∈ C(X)) ≥ 1−α for a user-specified significance level α. The size of the prediction set serves as an implicit measure of input difficulty and model uncertainty. *See also: calibration, predictive uncertainty.*\n\n**Credible Interval** — A Bayesian analogue of the confidence interval: an interval [a, b] such that the posterior probability of the parameter (or prediction) lying within the interval equals a specified level (e.g., 95%). Unlike frequentist confidence intervals, credible intervals have a direct probabilistic interpretation conditional on the observed data and the chosen prior. *See also: posterior predictive distribution, calibration.*\n\n**Distribution Shift** — A change in the statistical properties of data between the training distribution and the deployment (test) distribution. Forms include covariate shift (P(X) changes), label shift (P(Y) changes), and concept drift (P(Y|X) changes). Distribution shift degrades model performance and invalidates calibration guarantees, making it a central challenge for reliable uncertainty quantification in production systems. *See also: out-of-distribution detection, model robustness.*\n\n**Ensemble Methods** — An approach to uncertainty estimation that trains multiple models (typically 3–10) with different random initializations on the same data and aggregates their predictions. Disagreement among ensemble members captures epistemic uncertainty via the law of total variance. Deep ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al. 2017) are consistently among the best-calibrated UQ methods in empirical benchmarks, though at proportional computational cost. *See also: Bayesian neural network, epistemic uncertainty.*\n\n**Epistemic Uncertainty** — Uncertainty arising from limited knowledge, including insufficient training data, model misspecification, or parameter uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty is in principle reducible — it decreases as more data is observed or the model class is expanded. Distinguishing epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty is critical for actionable decision-making: high epistemic uncertainty suggests gathering more data, while high aleatoric uncertainty indicates an inherent limit. *See also: aleatoric uncertainty, Bayesian neural network.*\n\n**Model Robustness** — The degree to which a model maintains predictive accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty under perturbations, distribution shift, or adversarial attack. Robust models degrade gracefully rather than failing silently when inputs deviate from training conditions. Robustness is assessed through stress testing against corrupted data, adversarial perturbations, and natural distribution shifts. *See also: adversarial examples, distribution shift.*\n\n**Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection** — The task of identifying inputs that fall outside the distribution on which a model was trained, and for which predictions should not be trusted. Effective OOD detection is essential for safe deployment, as models often produce high-confidence but wrong predictions on OOD inputs. Methods include ensemble disagreement, distance-based approaches (e.g., Mahalanobis distance in feature space), and energy-based scoring. *See also: distribution shift, epistemic uncertainty.*\n\n**Posterior Predictive Distribution** — The distribution over future observations obtained by integrating out model parameters with respect to their posterior distribution: p(y*|x*,D) = ∫ p(y*|x*,θ) p(θ|D) dθ. This distribution naturally incorporates both parameter uncertainty (epistemic) and observation noise (aleatoric), providing a complete characterization of predictive uncertainty. It is the primary output of Bayesian inference for prediction tasks. *See also: Bayesian neural network, credible interval.*\n\n**Predictive Uncertainty** — The total uncertainty in a model's output for a given input, encompassing both aleatoric and epistemic components. Predictive uncertainty is typically quantified by the variance (or entropy) of the predictive distribution. In Bayesian settings, it decomposes as: Var[Y|X] = E[Var[Y|X,θ]] (aleatoric) + Var[E[Y|X,θ]] (epistemic), using the law of total variance. *See also: aleatoric uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty, posterior predictive distribution.*\n\n---\n\n*13 terms drafted.

First systematically characterised by Parasuraman & Manzey (2010), it manifests as both errors of commission (following incorrect automated advice) and errors of omission (failing to notice problems when automation does not flag them). Cross-ref: *over-reliance*, *cognitive bias*, *calibrated trust*.\n\n**Bounded Rationality** — Herbert Simon's (1955) concept that human decision-making is constrained by limited cognitive resources, incomplete information, and finite time, leading people to \"satisfice\" (find good-enough solutions) rather than optimise. In AI-assisted contexts, bounded rationality explains why users rely on heuristics and automation rather than fully processing all available uncertainty information. Cross-ref: *heuristic*, *cognitive load*.\n\n**Calibrated Trust** — A state in which a user's level of trust in a system accurately corresponds to the system's actual reliability and capability. Miscalibrated trust manifests as either over-trust (trusting the system more than its performance warrants) or under-trust (trusting it less). Achieving calibrated trust is the central goal of effective uncertainty communication. Cross-ref: *trust calibration*, *over-reliance*, *under-reliance*.\n\n**Cognitive Bias** — A systematic pattern of deviation from rational judgment, arising from heuristic processing, emotional influences, or cognitive limitations. In AI-assisted decision-making, relevant biases include anchoring (over-weighting initial information), probability neglect (ignoring likelihood when outcomes are emotionally salient), and ambiguity aversion (preferring known risks over unknown uncertainties). Cross-ref: *automation bias*, *heuristic*, *bounded rationality*.\n\n**Cognitive Load** — The total amount of mental effort being used in working memory at a given time (Sweller, 1988). High cognitive load degrades the ability to process complex information such as uncertainty estimates, pushing users toward simpler heuristic strategies. AI interface design must manage cognitive load — particularly in time-critical domains — by providing pre-attentive cues (colour, spatial layout) rather than requiring analytical processing. Cross-ref: *situational awareness*, *decision support*, *bounded rationality*.\n\n**Decision Support** — A system or interface designed to augment human decision-making by providing relevant information, analysis, or recommendations without replacing human judgment. Effective decision support for AI systems communicates not just recommendations but also the basis for those recommendations, including uncertainty, to enable appropriate human oversight. Cross-ref: *user agency*, *transparency*, *interpretability*.\n\n**Heuristic** — A mental shortcut or rule of thumb that simplifies complex judgments, enabling fast decisions under uncertainty at the cost of systematic errors. Tversky & Kahneman's (1974) heuristics-and-biases programme identified availability, representativeness, and anchoring-and-adjustment as foundational heuristics. In AI contexts, users apply heuristics to AI outputs (e.g., treating round confidence numbers as more trustworthy). Cross-ref: *cognitive bias*, *bounded rationality*.\n\n**Interpretability (User Perspective)** — The degree to which a human user can understand the reasoning or factors behind an AI system's output. Unlike technical model interpretability (which concerns internal mechanisms), user-facing interpretability focuses on whether explanations are *actionable* — whether they enable the user to appropriately assess when to trust, question, or override the system. Cross-ref: *transparency*, *mental model*, *decision support*.\n\n**Mental Model** — A user's internal representation of how a system works, what it can do, and where its limitations lie. Accurate mental models are essential for appropriate reliance on AI systems — users must understand the system's capability boundaries to know when to trust and when to override. Mental models are built through experience, training, and interface design, and may diverge significantly from actual system behaviour. Cross-ref: *calibrated trust*, *situational awareness*, *interpretability*.\n\n**Over-Reliance** — The behavioural pattern of depending on an AI system beyond what its actual reliability warrants, often manifesting as failure to verify AI outputs, failure to notice AI errors, or deferring to AI recommendations when the user's own judgment would be more appropriate. Over-reliance is the behavioural consequence of over-trust and is exacerbated by automation bias. Cross-ref: *automation bias*, *calibrated trust*, *under-reliance*.\n\n**Situational Awareness** — The perception of environmental elements, comprehension of their meaning, and projection of their future status (Endsley, 1995). In human-AI teaming, maintaining situational awareness requires that users remain engaged with the task context rather than passively monitoring automated outputs. Poor uncertainty communication can degrade situational awareness by either overwhelming the user with information or lulling them into complacent monitoring. Cross-ref: *cognitive load*, *over-reliance*, *mental model*.\n\n**Transparency** — The degree to which an AI system makes its processes, capabilities, limitations, and uncertainty accessible and understandable to its users. Research reveals a transparency-trust paradox: moderate transparency tends to increase trust, but excessive transparency (especially regarding uncertainty and limitations) can decrease trust even while improving decision quality (Kizilcec, 2016). Cross-ref: *interpretability*, *calibrated trust*, *user agency*.\n\n**Trust Calibration** — The process by which a user's trust in an AI system aligns (or fails to align) with the system's actual performance over time. Lee & See (2004) identify performance, process, and purpose as three bases of trust in automation. Trust calibration is dynamic — it shifts through repeated interactions, is lost quickly after errors but rebuilt slowly, and is influenced by how the system communicates its own uncertainty. Cross-ref: *calibrated trust*, *over-reliance*, *under-reliance*.\n\n**Under-Reliance** — The behavioural pattern of failing to use an AI system even when it would improve decision outcomes, often due to algorithm aversion (Dietvorst et al., 2015), prior negative experiences, or excessive scepticism. Under-reliance wastes the potential of AI assistance and can be triggered by uncertainty disclosure that signals unreliability rather than responsible self-awareness. Cross-ref: *calibrated trust*, *over-reliance*, *transparency*.\n\n**User Agency** — The user's capacity to make autonomous, informed decisions when interacting with an AI system, including the ability to override, modify, or reject AI recommendations. Preserving user agency is essential for appropriate human-AI complementarity — the user must remain an active decision-maker rather than a passive recipient of automated outputs. Systems that support adjustable reliance (e.g., user-configurable confidence thresholds) enhance user agency.

Post-hoc methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) treat the model as a black box and approximate its behaviour, making them model-agnostic but raising questions about faithfulness. Contrast with *ante-hoc interpretability*. See also: *faithfulness*, *explanation fidelity*.\n\n**Ante-Hoc Interpretability** — The property of a model that is inherently interpretable by design, such that its reasoning process can be directly inspected without requiring a separate explanation method. Examples include decision trees, linear models, rule lists, and architectures with built-in interpretability constraints (e.g., concept bottleneck models). Ante-hoc interpretable models avoid the faithfulness concerns of post-hoc methods but may trade off predictive performance. Contrast with *post-hoc explanation*.\n\n**Feature Importance** — A measure of how much each input feature contributes to a model's prediction, either globally (across the dataset) or locally (for a specific input). Feature importance can be computed via various methods including permutation importance, SHAP values, or gradient-based attribution. It is a general concept that subsumes several more specific techniques. See also: *SHAP*, *gradient-based attribution*, *saliency map*.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Methods and Techniques\n\n**LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** — A post-hoc explanation method that explains individual predictions by fitting a simple, interpretable surrogate model (typically a linear model) to the black-box model's behaviour in the local neighbourhood of the input. LIME perturbs the input, observes how the model's output changes, and uses these perturbation-response pairs to train the local surrogate. Its model-agnostic nature makes it widely applicable, but explanations can be unstable across perturbation samples and sensitive to the choice of neighbourhood kernel. See also: *post-hoc explanation*, *faithfulness*.\n\n**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** — A post-hoc explanation framework grounded in cooperative game theory that assigns each input feature a Shapley value representing its marginal contribution to a prediction. SHAP provides a unified measure of feature importance with desirable theoretical properties (local accuracy, missingness, consistency). Variants include KernelSHAP (model-agnostic, sampling-based), TreeSHAP (exact computation for tree ensembles), and DeepSHAP (approximation for neural networks). Computational cost can be high for the model-agnostic variant. See also: *feature importance*, *post-hoc explanation*.\n\n**Gradient-Based Attribution** — A family of post-hoc explanation methods for differentiable models (primarily neural networks) that compute the gradient of the output with respect to each input feature to determine feature relevance. Methods in this family include vanilla gradients (saliency maps), Integrated Gradients (which accumulates gradients along a path from a baseline to the input, satisfying an axiom of completeness), SmoothGrad (which averages gradients over noisy copies of the input to reduce visual noise), and Grad-CAM (which uses gradients flowing into convolutional layers to produce coarse localisation maps). See also: *saliency map*, *feature importance*.\n\n**Saliency Map** — A visual representation, typically overlaid on an input image, that highlights which regions or pixels were most influential in a model's prediction. Saliency maps are usually generated via gradient-based attribution methods and are among the most common explanation formats in computer vision. They are intuitive but can be misleading — research has shown that saliency maps can be visually similar for models with very different decision processes, raising faithfulness concerns. See also: *gradient-based attribution*, *faithfulness*.\n\n**Counterfactual Explanation** — An explanation that identifies the minimal change to an input that would alter the model's prediction to a specified alternative outcome (e.g., \"your loan application would have been approved if your income were £5,000 higher\"). Counterfactual explanations are actionable and intuitive because they describe what would need to be different, aligning with how humans naturally reason about causation. Key challenges include ensuring feasibility of the suggested changes, handling multiple valid counterfactuals (the Rashomon problem at the explanation level), and avoiding causal incoherence. See also: *contrastive explanation*, *contestability*.\n\n**Contrastive Explanation** — An explanation that answers the question \"Why outcome A rather than outcome B?\" rather than simply \"Why outcome A?\" Contrastive explanations reflect the structure of human explanatory reasoning, which is typically contrastive (Lipton 1990; Miller 2019). Counterfactual explanations are a specific type of contrastive explanation; more broadly, contrastive explanations can highlight the features that differentiate the predicted class from a specified foil class without requiring a concrete input change. See also: *counterfactual explanation*.\n\n**Concept-Based Explanation** — An explanation method that operates at the level of human-interpretable concepts (e.g., \"striped texture,\" \"wheel shape\") rather than raw input features (pixels, tokens). Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) is a prominent example: it learns directions in a network's activation space that correspond to user-defined concepts and measures how sensitive the model's predictions are to those concept directions. Concept-based explanations are more semantically meaningful than feature-level attributions but require a predefined concept vocabulary and labelled concept examples. See also: *feature importance*, *ante-hoc interpretability*.\n\n**Attention-Based Explanation** — An explanation derived from the attention weights of transformer or attention-mechanism models, under the assumption that higher attention weight on a token or region indicates greater relevance to the prediction. Attention-based explanations are computationally free (attention weights are already computed during inference) and intuitive, but their status as faithful explanations is contested. Jain & Wallace (2019) showed that attention weights often do not correlate with gradient-based feature importance, and alternative attention distributions can yield identical predictions. Wiegreffe & Pinter (2019) offered partial counter-evidence. The consensus is that attention provides a *description of information flow*, not a reliable causal explanation of the model's reasoning. See also: *faithfulness*, *saliency map*.\n\n**Mechanistic Interpretability** — A research programme that aims to reverse-engineer the internal computations of neural networks at the level of individual neurons, circuits (compositions of neurons), and features, rather than relying on input-output behavioural analysis. Pioneered in the context of transformer language models (Olah et al., Anthropic's interpretability work, Neel Nanda's circuit analysis), mechanistic interpretability seeks causal understanding of *how* the model computes its outputs, not just *which inputs matter*. It aspires to ante-hoc-level understanding of black-box models but is currently limited to small models or isolated circuits. See also: *ante-hoc interpretability*, *faithfulness*.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluative Concepts\n\n**Faithfulness** — The degree to which an explanation accurately reflects the actual reasoning process of the model it purports to explain. A faithful explanation captures the true causal factors behind a prediction; an unfaithful explanation may be plausible and persuasive but incorrect about what the model actually relied on. Faithfulness is the central quality criterion for explanations: an unfaithful explanation is worse than no explanation because it generates false confidence. It is distinct from *explanation fidelity* (which concerns approximation accuracy) and from plausibility (which concerns human judgement of whether an explanation seems reasonable). See also: *explanation fidelity*, *post-hoc explanation*.\n\n**Explanation Fidelity** — The accuracy with which a surrogate or approximate explanation method reproduces the behaviour of the model it explains, typically measured as the agreement between the surrogate's predictions and the original model's predictions in the relevant input region. High fidelity means the explanation method is a good local approximation of the model; low fidelity means the explanation may not reflect the model's actual behaviour. Fidelity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for faithfulness — a high-fidelity surrogate could still be unfaithful if it approximates the model's outputs without capturing its causal mechanisms. See also: *faithfulness*, *LIME*.\n\n**Rashomon Effect** — The phenomenon where multiple substantially different models (or explanations) achieve similar predictive performance on the same task, named after Akutagawa's story (via the Kurosawa film) in which different witnesses give equally plausible but contradictory accounts. In the model context (Breiman 2001), the Rashomon set is the set of all models with near-optimal performance — which may rely on different features and have different interpretations. In the explanation context, it means a single prediction may have multiple valid explanations, none uniquely correct. The Rashomon effect challenges the assumption that explanation can deliver a single authoritative account of a model's reasoning and has implications for regulatory requirements around explanation. See also: *counterfactual explanation*, *faithfulness*.\n\n---\n\n### Governance and Rights\n\n**Contestability** — The principle that individuals affected by AI-driven decisions should have the ability to challenge, question, and seek review of those decisions, and that AI systems should be designed to support this challenge. Contestability requires that the system provide sufficient information (including uncertainty and explanation) for a meaningful challenge to be mounted. It is a design property, not just a legal right — systems must be built with contestability affordances (explanation interfaces, appeal mechanisms, human review pathways). Contestability connects xAI to broader governance frameworks including the EU AI Act's right to explanation and due process norms. See also: *counterfactual explanation*, *post-hoc explanation*.\n\n---\n\n*End of xAI glossary draft — Demi (team-yrm)*\n*16 terms covered.

This is the non-negotiable starting point.\n2. **The criteria are more complementary than competing.** Alice's unique contribution (dialectical adequacy) addresses the *communicative structure* of explanations; Bob's unique contribution (empirical verifiability) addresses their *epistemic accountability*. These are different facets of explanation quality, not rival approaches.\n\n---\n\n### The Unified Rubric: Five Dimensions\n\nI propose five evaluation dimensions that integrate all six input criteria while resolving overlaps and preserving each contributor's distinctive insight. Each dimension includes a definition, a rationale for inclusion, and a practical evaluation question.\n\n---\n\n#### Dimension 1: Faithfulness\n\n**Definition**: The degree to which an explanation accurately represents the actual computational process the model used to produce its output — not a plausible post-hoc rationalisation, but a veridical account of the factors the model relied on.\n\n**Integrates**: Alice's \"Faithfulness\" + the core of Bob's \"Calibrated Faithfulness\"\n\n**Rationale**: Both Alice and Bob identified this as foundational, and both made the same argument: an unfaithful explanation generates false beliefs about model reasoning, making it epistemically worse than silence. This dimension is the sine qua non — it must be satisfied before other dimensions become meaningful.\n\n**Evaluation question**: *If we intervened on the factors identified by the explanation, would the model's output change as predicted?*\n\n**Scoring guidance**:\n- **High**: Explanation identifies factors that, when ablated or counterfactually altered, produce predicted changes in model output. Consistent across perturbation tests.\n- **Medium**: Explanation identifies generally relevant factors but with some inconsistency under perturbation. Partially faithful.\n- **Low**: Explanation highlights plausible-sounding but causally inert factors, or is contradicted by ablation/counterfactual testing.\n\n---\n\n#### Dimension 2: Uncertainty Communication\n\n**Definition**: The degree to which an explanation conveys the model's confidence in its output, distinguishes types of uncertainty (epistemic vs. aleatoric), and signals the boundaries of the model's competence — including whether the explanation's own attributions are robust or fragile.\n\n**Integrates**: Bob's \"Uncertainty Transparency\" + Bob's calibration layer from \"Calibrated Faithfulness\" + elements of Alice's \"Epistemic Proportionality\" (matching explanation depth to uncertainty level)\n\n**Rationale**: Bob's insistence that explanations must surface what the model does *not* know is essential for appropriate reliance. Alice's epistemic proportionality criterion reinforces this from a different angle — higher uncertainty demands richer explanation. I unify these into a single dimension because both point to the same functional requirement: the explanation must enable the user to calibrate their trust.\n\n**Evaluation question**: *After receiving this explanation, can the user distinguish cases where the model is reliable from cases where it is not?*\n\n**Scoring guidance**:\n- **High**: Explanation explicitly communicates confidence level, identifies uncertainty type, flags out-of-distribution or edge cases, and indicates robustness of its own attributions.\n- **Medium**: Explanation communicates a confidence score or qualitative indication but does not distinguish uncertainty types or flag scope limitations.\n- **Low**: Explanation presents model output without any indication of confidence, uncertainty, or known limitations.\n\n---\n\n#### Dimension 3: Dialectical Adequacy\n\n**Definition**: The degree to which an explanation provides sufficient argumentative structure — claims, warrants, evidence, and conditions of rebuttal — for a competent recipient to evaluate, challenge, and engage in reasoned disagreement with the model's reasoning.\n\n**Integrates**: Alice's \"Dialectical Adequacy\" (primary source, preserved intact as a distinct dimension)\n\n**Rationale**: This is Alice's most distinctive contribution and has no counterpart in Bob's criteria. From a human factors perspective, it addresses a critical gap: many technically faithful explanations fail to support human oversight because they offer no structure for the user to *push back against*. A feature weight list is faithful but not dialectically adequate — there is nothing to argue with. A counterfactual explanation or structured argument graph, by contrast, invites the user to ask \"but what about...?\" and receive a coherent response. This dimension is what separates explanations that *inform* from those that enable *epistemic agency*.\n\n**Evaluation question**: *Can a domain expert identify a specific claim in the explanation and articulate a principled challenge to it?*\n\n**Scoring guidance**:\n- **High**: Explanation presents an identifiable claim-warrant-evidence structure. A recipient can pinpoint specific premises, evaluate their strength, and articulate conditions under which the explanation would fail.\n- **Medium**: Explanation provides some reasoning structure (e.g., \"because of factors X, Y, Z\") but the connections between factors and conclusions are implicit rather than explicit.\n- **Low**: Explanation is a flat output (e.g., attribution scores, saliency map) with no argumentative structure to engage with.\n\n---\n\n#### Dimension 4: Empirical Verifiability\n\n**Definition**: The degree to which an explanation's claims are testable — whether through controlled experiments (ablation, counterfactual intervention), held-out evaluation, or comparison against ground-truth reasoning processes — rather than relying solely on subjective plausibility.\n\n**Integrates**: Bob's \"Empirical Verifiability\" (primary source, preserved as a distinct dimension)\n\n**Rationale**: This is Bob's most distinctive contribution and addresses a systemic problem in the XAI literature: methods that produce compelling outputs but resist systematic evaluation. From a human factors perspective, verifiability is the mechanism by which explanation quality can be *measured* rather than merely judged, enabling iterative improvement and cross-method comparison. Without it, explanation evaluation reduces to aesthetic preference.\n\n**Evaluation question**: *Can we design an experiment that would falsify this explanation's claims?*\n\n**Scoring guidance**:\n- **High**: Explanation generates specific, testable predictions. Claims can be checked via ablation studies, counterfactual interventions, or comparison with known ground-truth reasoning. Fidelity metrics are computable.\n- **Medium**: Explanation makes claims that are partially testable but some aspects resist empirical check (e.g., claims about \"importance\" that are difficult to operationalise precisely).\n- **Low**: Explanation is not falsifiable in any practical sense — its claims are vague, subjective, or unfalsifiable by design.\n\n---\n\n#### Dimension 5: Contextual Proportionality\n\n**Definition**: The degree to which the explanation's depth, precision, format, and information type are appropriately calibrated to (a) the stakes of the decision, (b) the competence and needs of the recipient, and (c) the nature and magnitude of the uncertainty involved.\n\n**Integrates**: Alice's \"Epistemic Proportionality\" (primary source, extended with user-centred considerations)\n\n**Rationale**: Alice's insight that adequate justification depends partly on practical stakes (the pragmatic encroachment thesis) is essential for a rubric intended for real-world application. I extend it with human factors considerations: proportionality is not just about *how much* explanation to provide, but *what kind*. A radiologist needs different explanation depth and format than a patient; a routine classification needs less than a borderline case. This dimension ensures the rubric is sensitive to deployment context rather than treating explanation quality as context-independent.\n\n**Evaluation question**: *Given the specific decision, user, and uncertainty level, does this explanation provide the right amount and type of information — neither overwhelming routine cases nor under-serving critical ones?*\n\n**Scoring guidance**:\n- **High**: Explanation depth and format are well-matched to the decision stakes, user expertise, and uncertainty level. High-stakes, high-uncertainty cases receive richer, multi-layered explanation. Routine, high-confidence cases receive appropriately concise explanation.\n- **Medium**: Explanation is generally appropriate but applies a uniform depth regardless of context (e.g., always verbose, or always minimal).\n- **Low**: Explanation is systematically mismatched — either overwhelming low-stakes decisions with unnecessary complexity or providing a bare confidence score for consequential, uncertain decisions.\n\n---\n\n### How the Five Dimensions Relate\n\n```\n                    ┌─────────────────────┐\n                    │   1.

In research or model development contexts, empirical verifiability may take precedence. Contextual proportionality exists precisely to mediate these trade-offs.\n\n2. **The rubric is designed for evaluators, not end-users.** End-users experience the *effects* of these dimensions (they feel trust, confusion, or confidence); evaluators apply the rubric to assess whether the explanation is likely to produce appropriate effects.\n\n3. **Minimum viable explanation.** An explanation that scores \"High\" on faithfulness and \"Medium\" on the remaining four dimensions is preferable to one that scores \"High\" on all dimensions except faithfulness. The hierarchy matters.\n\n4. **Tension between dimensions is expected.** A maximally dialectically adequate explanation (rich argumentative structure) may violate contextual proportionality in routine cases. A maximally verifiable explanation (everything operationalised for testing) may sacrifice some dialectical richness. The rubric invites evaluators to navigate these tensions explicitly rather than pretending they don't exist.\n\n---\n\n*This rubric integrates Alice's philosophical lens (faithfulness, dialectical structure, proportionality to stakes) with Bob's technical lens (calibrated confidence, uncertainty transparency, empirical testability) into a coherent framework that a practitioner can apply systematically. The five dimensions are ordered from foundational (faithfulness) to contextual (proportionality), with three independent quality dimensions in between.*","mentions":[],"thread_id":null}

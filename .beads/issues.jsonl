{"id":"team-18b","title":"Sidebar overhaul: dynamic DMs, collapsible sections, and channel consolidation","description":"## Overview\n\nThe sidebar needs a significant overhaul to support dynamically created agents and channels, with collapsible sections and proper CRUD workflows. Currently, DMs are hardcoded to 3 system agents (alice/bob/charlie) in `AGENTS` constant, channels can't be managed inline, and the sidebar doesn't scale well as lists grow.\n\n## Current State\n\n### DMs (`nav-dms.tsx`)\n- **Hardcoded** to `AGENTS` constant (alice, bob, charlie) — no way to DM user-created agents\n- Online status and unread counts work for the 3 system agents\n- No add/remove DM capability\n\n### Channels (`nav-channels.tsx`)\n- **Dynamic** — fetched from `/api/backend/channels` via SWR\n- Has \"Create Channel\" (+) button and settings gear icon per non-system channel\n- `ChannelManageDialog` supports adding/removing agents and users, ownership transfer, delete\n- **Bug (original 18b):** `#team` channel only exists in JSONL system, not SQLite — doesn't appear in sidebar\n\n### Sidebar (`app-sidebar.tsx`)\n- Three flat sections: Channels, DMs, nav links (Monitoring, Agents, Admin)\n- **Not collapsible** — no way to collapse sections when lists grow long\n- No collapsible UI component exists yet (need to add shadcn `Collapsible`)\n\n### Agent System\n- System agents: `alice`, `bob`, `charlie` (hardcoded in `constants.ts`, `is_system: true`)\n- User agents: created via Agents page, stored as `.claude/agents/{name}.md` with `owner` field\n- `getAgent()` already has a fallback for unknown IDs — returns generated defaults\n- Backend already supports listing all agents via `GET /api/agents`\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. Consolidate #team channel into SQLite (original 18b)\n- Ensure `#team` has a row in the `channels` table with `owner_id='system'`\n- Either seed it on server startup or migrate it\n- After this, #team appears in the sidebar like any other channel\n\n### 2. Dynamic DMs — fetch agents from API\n- Replace the hardcoded `AGENTS` constant in `nav-dms.tsx` with a fetch to `/api/agents` (or a new endpoint)\n- Show **only user-owned agents** (non-system) in the DM list — system agents (alice/bob/charlie) are always shown\n- When a user creates a new agent on the Agents page, it should immediately appear in the DM sidebar\n- The DM page (`/dm/[agent]`) already works for any agent ID via `getAgent()` fallback — just needs the sidebar entry\n- Online status and unread counts should work for dynamic agents too\n\n### 3. Channel CRUD from sidebar\n- Channel creation already works (+ button → `/channels/new`)\n- Channel settings already work (gear icon → `ChannelManageDialog`)\n- Channel deletion is inside `ChannelManageDialog` — this is sufficient\n- **Ensure**: users can only delete channels they own; system channels are not deletable (already enforced)\n\n### 4. Collapsible sidebar sections\n- Add shadcn `Collapsible` component (`npx shadcn@latest add collapsible`)\n- Wrap both \"Channels\" and \"Direct Messages\" `SidebarGroup` sections with collapsible behavior\n- Clicking the section header (label) toggles collapse/expand\n- Default to expanded; persist collapse state in localStorage\n- Use chevron icon to indicate expand/collapse state\n\n## Key Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `team-dashboard/src/components/sidebar/nav-dms.tsx` | Replace hardcoded AGENTS with API fetch; show user agents |\n| `team-dashboard/src/components/sidebar/nav-channels.tsx` | Wrap in Collapsible |\n| `team-dashboard/src/components/sidebar/app-sidebar.tsx` | Adjust layout for collapsible sections |\n| `team-dashboard/src/lib/constants.ts` | Keep AGENTS for system agent styling; add agent type |\n| `team-dashboard/src/components/ui/collapsible.tsx` | Add shadcn collapsible component |\n| `team-server/src/index.ts` | Seed #team channel on startup; possibly new endpoint for DM-eligible agents |\n| `team-server/src/db.ts` | Seed logic for system channels |\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Agent creation/editing from sidebar (use Agents page)\n- Channel creation inline (keep existing /channels/new page flow)\n- DMs between human users (only user→agent DMs)\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-29T20:06:23.024743Z","created_by":"cburr","updated_at":"2026-01-30T10:50:39.295989Z","closed_at":"2026-01-30T10:50:39.295989Z","close_reason":"Implemented collapsible sidebar sections, dynamic agent DMs via API, filtered non-core system agents, fixed hardcoded AGENT_IDS, and capitalized display names"}

{"id":"team-2n1","title":"Orchestrator should DM agents to dispatch work instead of relying on @mentions","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen the orchestrator decomposes a task, it creates beads issues and posts a summary to a channel, but never actually triggers agents to start working. Agents are not informed of their assignments.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe orchestrator skill creates issues and posts @mentions in channel messages, but:\n1. MCP channel_write does not trigger agents for @mentions (only the HTTP path does)\n2. Even if it did, the orchestrator doesn't reliably format @mentions\n\n## Solution\n\nRather than fixing @mention detection in the MCP path (fragile), the orchestrator should explicitly DM each assigned agent via message_send to dispatch work. This uses the existing reliable DM trigger path.\n\n### New orchestrator dispatch flow:\n\n1. Create epic + subtask issues in beads\n2. For each unblocked subtask with an assignee, send a DM via message_send:\n   - To: the assigned agent (e.g. \"alice\")\n   - Content: instruction to work on the issue (e.g. \"You have been assigned team-xyz: \u003ctitle\u003e. Run /plan-issue team-xyz to begin. Post findings to #\u003cchannel\u003e. When complete, close the issue with bd close and message me back.\")\n3. Each agent gets triggered via the existing DM dispatch path (polling detects unread → triggerAgent)\n4. Agents work, close their issue, DM the orchestrator when done\n5. Orchestrator gets triggered by reply DMs, can check progress and advance blocked work\n\n### Changes required:\n\n- Update .claude/commands/orchestrate:decompose.md — Step 5 (\"Trigger First Wave\") should use message_send to DM each agent instead of @mentioning in a channel post\n- Update dispatcher.ts orchestrator prompt — reinforce that agents must be dispatched via message_send, not @mentions\n- Optionally update orchestrate:status.md — when advancing newly-unblocked work, also DM the assigned agents\n\n## Files\n\n- .claude/commands/orchestrate:decompose.md — decomposition skill Step 5\n- .agents/identities/orchestrator.md — orchestrator communication patterns\n- team-server/src/dispatcher.ts — orchestrator prompt construction (~line 1001)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-30T15:57:35.811751Z","created_by":"cburr","updated_at":"2026-01-31T05:32:21.670687Z","closed_at":"2026-01-31T05:32:21.670687Z","close_reason":"Verified working: orchestrator DMs agents via message_send to dispatch work.

This enables Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Demi to process large research papers directly within their workflows.\n\nDocumentation: https://docling-project.github.io/docling/usage/mcp/\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Add and configure the MCP server\n\nAdd the Docling MCP server to the project's MCP configuration. The server runs via `uvx`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"docling\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"--from=docling-mcp\", \"docling-mcp-server\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRequires Python/uvx to be available. Verify the server starts and responds to tool calls.\n\n### 2. Configure permissions in settings\n\nAdd the Docling MCP tools to the allowed permissions in `settings.local.json` (or `settings.json` if project-wide is preferred). Ensure the MCP server tools are granted without interactive prompts during agent sessions.\n\n### 3. Update agent system prompts (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Demi)\n\nUpdate the identity/system prompt files for all four agents in `.agents/identities/` so they know:\n- The Docling MCP server is available for converting PDFs to markdown\n- When encountering a research paper or PDF, they should use the Docling tools to convert it\n- Converted markdown should be saved to the shared research sources directory\n\n### 4. Create a Research Sources directory\n\nSet up a `research-sources/` directory (or similar) at the project root where converted markdown files can be stored and shared across agents. Add a brief README explaining the directory's purpose and naming conventions for converted documents.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Docling MCP server is configured and starts successfully\n- [ ] Permissions allow agents to use Docling tools without manual approval\n- [ ] All four agents (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Demi) have updated prompts referencing the capability\n- [ ] `research-sources/` directory exists with a README\n- [ ] An agent can successfully convert a PDF to markdown using the Docling tools\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-30T15:18:45.253841Z","created_by":"cburr","updated_at":"2026-01-30T15:19:42.444472Z"}

{"id":"team-bl1","title":"Improve slash command system messages UX in dashboard","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen slash commands (e.g. /orchestrate:decompose, /standup) are executed from the dashboard chat UI, multiple system messages pile up in the message area with poor UX:\n\n1. **Too many system messages**: Each command shows 2+ system messages (e.g. \"Starting task decomposition...\" then \"Decomposition started. Session ID: ...\"). This clutters the chat view.\n2. **System messages don't reflow with new messages**: System messages are rendered after the MessageList in a separate section. When new agent messages arrive via WebSocket, the system messages stay pinned below them rather than being interleaved chronologically. They appear disconnected from the conversation flow.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `chat-area.tsx`, system messages are stored in a separate `systemMessages` state array and rendered in a `div` after `\u003cMessageList\u003e`. They are not part of the `visibleMessages` array, so they don't participate in chronological ordering or scroll behavior.\n\nEach command handler calls `addSystemMessage()` multiple times (once for \"starting...\" and once for the result), creating visual noise.\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\n- Slash commands should show a single, concise inline notification that updates in place (e.g. a toast or a single system message that transitions from \"Starting...\" to the result).\n- System messages should appear inline with regular messages in chronological order, not in a separate section below the message list.\n- When new channel messages arrive, the system feedback should not shift or appear disconnected.\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- `team-dashboard/src/components/chat/chat-area.tsx` — system message state and rendering\n- `team-dashboard/src/components/chat/system-message-item.tsx` — system message component\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Open dashboard, navigate to any channel\n2. Type `/orchestrate:decompose Build a calibration pipeline` and press Enter\n3.

However, the Claude CLI process sometimes completes its work but never actually exits — it hangs at 0% CPU indefinitely.\n\nThis leaves the dispatcher thinking the agent is still active, blocking any new work from being dispatched to that agent.\n\n## Observed\n\n- Orchestrator PID 44266 ran for 33+ minutes at 0% CPU after completing its decomposition task\n- `proc.exited` promise never resolved, so `onComplete` was never called\n- Dispatcher reported `active: true` with `activeForMs: null` and `lastExitCode: 0` (stale from previous run)\n- Could not refresh or re-trigger the orchestrator: 'has an active session — cannot refresh while running'\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe Claude CLI with `-p` flag sometimes hangs after completing work, possibly waiting for MCP server cleanup or stdio drain. The dispatcher has no timeout or watchdog to detect this.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd a watchdog/timeout mechanism to spawnClaudeSession():\n1. Track when the last stdout/stderr output was received\n2. If no output for N minutes (e.g. 5min) and the process is still running, consider it stale\n3. Send SIGTERM, wait briefly, then SIGKILL if needed\n4. Call onComplete with a special exit code indicating timeout\n\nAlternatively or additionally:\n- Add a max session duration (e.g. 10min) after which the process is killed\n- The existing stale process reaping in dispatcher.ts may need to cover this case\n\n## Files\n\n- team-server/src/dispatcher.ts — spawnClaudeSession() (lines 75-238), stale process detection","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"chrisdburr@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T05:57:57.298472Z","created_by":"Christopher Burr","updated_at":"2026-01-31T06:49:29.81063Z","closed_at":"2026-01-31T06:49:29.81063Z","close_reason":"Closed"}

Avatar Selection \u0026 Upload\n\n**Option A: Choose from preloaded icons**\n- Use lucide-react icons (already in project) as avatar options\n- Provide a grid of relevant icons (Bot, Brain, Code, Lightbulb, etc.)\n- Quick selection without needing to upload files\n\n**Option B: Upload custom image**\n- Move existing `images/` directory to `public/avatars/` for web access\n- Add image upload field to create/edit agent forms\n- Store uploaded avatars alongside existing team avatars (alice.jpeg, bob.jpeg, etc.)\n\n**Edit existing agents**\n- Add edit functionality to `/agents` page\n- Allow changing avatar for existing agents (both custom agents and team agents)\n\n### 2. AI-Drafted System Prompts\nInstead of users writing system prompts manually:\n- User provides a short description of the agent's purpose/role\n- \"Team Chat AI Agent\" (General Team Chat Assistant) expands this into a full system prompt\n- Use a template that ensures consistency across agents:\n  - Standard structure matching alice/bob/charlie format\n  - Correct tool access declarations\n  - Proper identity and working style sections\n  - Team collaboration guidelines\n\n## Current State\n\n- Icon library: **lucide-react** (^0.563.0)\n- Existing avatars in `images/`: alice.jpeg, bob.jpeg, charlie.jpeg, team.png\n- Team avatars currently served from `/public/avatars/` (need to consolidate)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `team-dashboard/src/components/agents/create-agent-dialog.tsx` - Add avatar picker\n- `team-dashboard/src/components/agents/agents-library.tsx` - Add edit functionality\n- `team-dashboard/src/components/agents/agent-library-card.tsx` - Edit button\n- New: `team-dashboard/src/components/agents/avatar-picker.tsx` - Icon/upload picker\n- `team-server/src/agents.ts` - Handle avatar storage in frontmatter\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Icon picker with lucide-react options in create form\n- [ ] Optional image upload for custom avatars\n- [ ] Move `images/` to consolidated avatar location\n- [ ] Edit functionality for existing agent avatars on /agents page\n- [ ] Short description field that triggers AI expansion\n- [ ] Generated prompts follow consistent template/structure\n- [ ] User can review/edit generated prompt before saving\n- [ ] New agents have same tool access pattern as team agents","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-29T06:26:40.128241Z","created_by":"cburr","updated_at":"2026-01-30T07:14:25.071812Z","closed_at":"2026-01-30T07:14:25.071812Z","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"team-kt0","depends_on_id":"team-dqy","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-29T06:32:17.556677Z","created_by":"cburr"}]}

This enables Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Demi to search, retrieve, and annotate research papers directly from Zotero within their workflows.\n\n## Background\n\nZotero MCP provides tools for searching a Zotero library (keyword + semantic search), retrieving full-text content, accessing PDF annotations, and managing notes. It supports both the local Zotero API (requires Zotero 7+ running) and the Zotero Web API.\n\nPrerequisites: Python 3.10+, Zotero 7+ (for local mode)\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Install and configure the MCP server\n\nInstall via uv:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nuv tool install \"git+https://github.com/54yyyu/zotero-mcp.git\"\nzotero-mcp setup\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nAdd to MCP configuration:\n\\`\\`\\`json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"zotero\": {\n      \"command\": \"zotero-mcp\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"ZOTERO_LOCAL\": \"true\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nDecide on connection mode:\n- **Local API** (\\`ZOTERO_LOCAL=true\\`): Requires Zotero 7+ running on the host. Provides full-text access.\n- **Web API** (\\`ZOTERO_API_KEY\\`, \\`ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID\\`): Works without a local Zotero instance but may have limitations.\n\nOptionally configure semantic search (embedding model for similarity-based queries):\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nzotero-mcp setup --semantic-config-only\nzotero-mcp update-db --fulltext\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### 2. Configure permissions in settings\n\nAdd the Zotero MCP tools to the allowed permissions in \\`settings.local.json\\` (or \\`settings.json\\`).
